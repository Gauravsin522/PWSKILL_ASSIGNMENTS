    "### 1. Discuss the scenarios where multithreading is preferable to multiprocessing and scenarios where multiprocessing is a better choice.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:-\n",
    "Multithreading vs. Multiprocessing:\n",
    "Multithreading is preferable when tasks are I/O-bound (e.g., file reading, network requests), where waiting for external resources dominates execution time. Threads share memory, allowing faster context switching and communication between them.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multiprocessing is better suited for CPU-bound tasks (e.g., complex calculations, heavy data processing), where multiple processes can fully utilize multiple CPU cores. It isolates memory, which prevents data corruption but involves more overhead in communication and memory usage."

    "### 2. Describe what a process pool is and how it helps in managing multiple processes efficiently.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Answer:- process pool is a mechanism that manages a collection of worker processes for efficiently handling multiple tasks in parallel. It provides a pool of reusable processes, which can execute tasks concurrently and avoid the overhead of creating and destroying processes repeatedly. By reusing the same processes, a pool reduces resource consumption and improves performance for CPU-bound tasks. It also simplifies the distribution of work across multiple cores, automatically assigning tasks to available workers, making it ideal for parallelizing tasks in multiprocessing environments.\n"
